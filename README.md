# AI-Powered Content Recommendation System

A microservice-based recommendation system that automatically generates content tags and provides related content suggestions using BERTopic and cosine similarity.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Automated Content Tagging**: Leverages BERTopic model for intelligent tag generation
- **Content-Based Recommendation Engine**: Provides related content suggestions using cosine similarity
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with microservices architecture using FastAPI and Pub/Sub
- **Real-time Processing**: Asynchronous processing of content using message queues

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Machine Learning**: BERTopic, BERT
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Caching**: Redis
- **API Testing**: Locust
- **Message Queue**: Google Pub/Sub
- **Architecture**: Microservices

## üìã System Components

1. **Tag Generation Service**

   - Subscribes to Pub/Sub message queue
   - Processes incoming content using BERTopic
   - Automatically generates relevant tags
   - Updates content metadata in MongoDB

2. **Recommendation Service**
   - RESTful API endpoint for content recommendations
   - Content-based filtering using cosine similarity
   - Returns upto 10 most relevant content pieces
